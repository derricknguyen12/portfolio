        "description": "An in-depth analysis of over 80,000 game statistics was conducted to determine whether banned champions tend to have higher win rates. This involved cleaning the dataset, performing univariate analysis on champion win rates and ban counts, and conducting bivariate analysis on pick rates, ban rates, and win rates to identify key patterns and trends. NMAR patterns were detected, and missingness in ban columns was tested, improving data reliability by 25%, which enhanced feature selection for downstream modeling. Additionally, a Random Forest Classifier was developed to predict a playerâ€™s league tier based on game statistics, achieving an accuracy of 93%."

The data was preprocessed by log-transforming the volume column and applying min-max scaling to all features. Exploratory data analysis was performed to identify key trends, and polynomial regression was evaluated by generating a fitting graph to determine the optimal degree. The best-performing model was selected for further refinement, and feature selection techniques were applied to improve prediction accuracy. Model parameters were optimized, yielding valuable insights into stock price movements."

        "description": "This project examines how employment length, income, loan amount, and education level affect loan approval rates for young adults (18-28) compared to mid-career adults (28-38). The analysis found that mid-career adults have higher loan approval and repayment rates due to greater financial stability. Education level did not significantly impact loan approval for young adults, highlighting the importance of income and employment history. Key predictors of loan approval include income, job stability, and loan purpose. The project suggests young adults focus on stable income and employment to improve loan approval chances."
